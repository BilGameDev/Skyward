# Notice
This game does not use any runner templates and was made from the ground up with the help of a few visual assets.
The game uses a curved shader with the help of Curved Worlds, an asset available to purchase from the Unity Asset Store. I have removed it from the project files in this repo as I have no rights to distribute it. 
Everything else present in the repo is available for free on the Asset Store.

The music and SFX are obtained from Pixabay and edited by me on Fl-Studio.
The dependency injection used is called Zenject.

Skyward is a unique endless runner game that introduces a new type of input and gameplay mechanics than the traditional swipe based runners. Skyward allows complete and constant control over your player object which in this case is a Bird.

As the player, you must collect feathers while avoiding obstacles. For now..

I want this game to actually be level based instead of a procedurally generated runner. I plan to add more levels and themes to the game in the future.

The game lets the users customize their bird using random colors and then fly through an Apple Orchard, collecting feathers until the player loses the game by colliding with an object.

I also make use of PlatinoTween, a plugin to help create UI animations to give a nice feel to the game.

This is one of my more simpler projects. I will continue work on this as i plan to release atleast 3 different themes in a couple of months.

Hope you like it!
